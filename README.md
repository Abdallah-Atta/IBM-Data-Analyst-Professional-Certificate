# IBM-Data-Analyst-Capstone-Project

#### Week 1 data collection 
My first task is to gather a list of the most in-demand programming skills from job advertising, training websites, and polls, among other sources. In order to gather data in many formats like .CSV files, Excel sheets, and databases, I will start by scraping internet websites and using APIs.
#### Week 2 data wrangling 
Data wrangling techniques will be used to prepare the acquired data for analysis.
#### Week 3 exploratory data analysis 
Once I've retrieved and cleaned enough data, I will use statistical methods to analyze the data. 
#### Week 4 data visualization 
Involves creating charts and graphs to visualize the data 
#### Week 5 building a dashboard 
I'll use IBM Cognos Analytics to build a dashboard that will compile all of the data and nd spot trends and insights that might include the following:
Which programming languages are most in demand today?
What are the most in-demand database skills?
Which IDEs are the most popular?
#### Week 6 presentation of findings.
I use storytelling to share my findings in a presentation.
